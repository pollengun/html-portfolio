  <h3>3 Idiots</h3>
  <p>
    This is a bollywood movie. It shows the feelings of students and what should be their attitude towards learning.
  </p>
  <h3>In the Shadow of the Moon</h3>
  <p>This is a beautiful sci-fi movie with a good suspence story.</p>
  <h3>The Dictator</h3>
  <p>
    Epitome of goofy comedy movie. If you want some light hearted comedy, you should definitely give it  a go.
